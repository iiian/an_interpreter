// Build an interpreter
// This interpreter will support literal expressions
// This interpreter will support assigment statements, and need to capture the left hand side of the assignment in-memory
// This interpreter will support function calls, and need to capture the function name in-memory
// This interpreter will support some primitive types, and primitive operations
// This interpreter will support basic structs, with named fields
// This interpreter will support consuming a stream of tokens


// raw text -> token stream -> AST -> interpreter -> output
